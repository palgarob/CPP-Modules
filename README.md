## 🛫 Intro

These modules are a structured series of projects designed to introduce students to the core principles of C++ programming. These modules serve as a progressive learning path, covering everything from basic syntax and memory management to advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) and modern C++ features. The primary goal is to develop a strong understanding of C++.

Each module builds upon the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity to ensure a comprehensive grasp of C++. By the end of Module 09, students will have acquired the ability to write robust, efficient, and scalable C++ applications while following industry standards and best practices.

### Key Concepts Covered

| Concept | Description | Link |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Basic Syntax and Data Types** | Introduction to C++ syntax, variables, operators, control structures, and basic input/output. | [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Basic_syntax) |
| **Memory Management** | Covers dynamic memory allocation, pointers, references, and the importance of avoiding memory leaks. | [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management) |
| **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** | Introduces classes, objects, constructors, destructors, and encapsulation. | [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) |
| **Inheritance and Polymorphism** | Explores class hierarchies, virtual functions, and dynamic binding. | [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)) |
| **Abstract Classes and Interfaces** | Delves into abstract base classes, pure virtual functions, and interface design. | [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_type) |
| **Operator Overloading** | Teaches how to redefine operators for custom types to improve usability and readability. | [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading) |
| **Type Casting** | Covers implicit and explicit conversions, `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, and `reinterpret_cast`. | [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_conversion) |
| **Templates and Generics** | Introduces function and class templates to create flexible and reusable code. | [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_(C%2B%2B)) |
| **STL (Standard Template Library)** | Explains key STL components like containers, iterators, and algorithms. | [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library) |
| **Smart Pointers and Modern C++ Features** | Introduces `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr`, lambda expressions, and other C++11+ features. | [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer) |

These modules not only reinforce fundamental programming skills but also introduce best practices, such as adhering to the **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)** paradigm and writing efficient, maintainable code. By completing these modules, students gain a deep understanding of C++ and are well-prepared for real-world software development challenges.

## ✨ Characteristics

- The code must be [c++98](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-98-standard/) compatible.

- This programs have been tested on Linux and macOS.

## 🛠️ Tools used

You'll find the information for each module in the subjects. The tools to be used are varied, depending on what is required and the depth one develops on each concept. The table in the [intro](#-intro) can give you an idea of this.

## 🚀 Quick guide

Each exercise has its own make. Running `make` and then the executable should show the tests implemented in the main of each program. Since the only reason to access these modules is to learn C++, it is probably a good idea to play with the tests or make one's own.

## 🎨 Bonus

Theoretically, there aren't. Nevertheless, from mo00-mo04, the last exercise is optional. I've made:
| Module  | Status       |
|-------|------------|
| mo00  | ✅ Done       |
| mo01  | ✅ Done       |
| mo02  | 🚧 Working on it |
| mo03  | 🚧 Working on it |
| mo04  | 🚧 Working on it |
